### Slimming Gusto, Tasty Guilt Free Recipes.

Slimming Gusto is a recipe app that provides a place for people to share healthy delicious food recipes for people to follow and create.

The website is aimed at people who maybe trying to loose weight following diet plans from weight loss companies or users who just want 
good healthy meals.

This site was conceived from my own personal journey with loosing weight and to show that you can still have great tasting meals even when
following a strict diet plan. There are many misconceptions about diet plans from tiny portions to horrible cardboard food. This is 
totally not the case and this app is here to prove that you can still eat good sized meals with zero guilt or regret!

## Design

I did the design for this website using Balsamiq to create the wireframes. I have created wireframes for all pages on desktop, tablet and mobile.

### Wireframes

|  [Edit Recipe Page](https://github.com/horizons83/Milestone3-Slimming-Gusto/blob/master/readme-documents/wireframes/wireframe-edit-recipe.pdf)  	|

### Fonts

For typography I have used Pacifico for the main app title and also some page headings. I then used Roboto for main text sections some
the main text bodies are clear for the user to read.

### Colour Scheme

I wanted to keep the colour scheme soft so used a mixture of soft greens and off whites.
I have created a palette using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and it is displayed below.

## Defensive Design

* Users cannot brute force their way onto pages that they donâ€™t have access to eg a not logged in user cannot access the add_recipe page by adding /add_recipe to the url, a flash message will be displayed asking them to log in.
* Only logged in users can access the add recipe page.
* Logged in users can only edit/delete their own recipes.
* Only admin user can access the admin pages.
* 404 error page has being included.

# Deployment

This website was created in the Gitpod development environment. After creating a new repository in GitHub using the Code Institute template, the green Gitpod button was used to initialise the repository in Gitpod. Throughout the process the git commands `git add` and `git commit` were used to store the work in the local Gitpod environment, `git push` would then be used to push the commits to the GitHub repository. From here the website could then deployed via Heroku.

## Heroku Deployment

Before creating the application in Heroku, 

1. Create a requirements.txt file in your work environment by running the following command in the command line interface:

	`pip3 freeze â€”local > requirements.txt`

This will save all the dependencies currently used by the app to the requirements.txt file.

2. Create a Procfile, which tells Heroku which file runs the app and how to run it. To do this run the following command in the CLI:

	`echo web: python app.py > Procfile`

3. `Git add`, `git commit` and `git push` these files to GitHub so they are available to Heroku which will use them to build the app.

### In Heroku

1. Login and click New -> Create New App
	- Add a name
	- Select region
	- Click Create App

2. Select Connect to GitHub, when the Github profile is displayed add the name of your repo and click search, once it finds & displays the correct repo click connect.

3. Set up the config vars required to run the app. In the Settings Tab click Revel Config Vars
- Create the following variables and assign their values:
            IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI, MONGO_DBNAME
- Click Hide Config Vars

4. In the Deploy Tab
	- Click Enable Automatic Deploys
	- Select the branch the repo is using
	- Click Deploy Branch
 => Your app was successfully deployed will be displayed with the option to view the app.

## Creating A Local Clone

You can clone the repository to create a local copy on your computer.

From the Git Hub repository:
- Click `Code` at the top of the file list
- Click the clipboard icon to copy the url provided

Open terminal:
- Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be
- Type `git clone` and paste the copied url after it
- Press enter and the clone will be created
