### Slimming Gusto, Tasty Guilt Free Recipies.

Slimming Gusto is a recipe app that provides a place for people to share healthy delicious food recipes for people to follow and create.

The website is aimed at people who maybe trying to loose weight following diet plans from weight loss companies or users who just want 
good healty meals.

This site was conceived from my own personal journey with loosing weight and to show that you can still have great tasting meals even when
following a strict diet plan. There are many misconceptions about diet plans from tiny portions to horrible cardboard food. This is 
totally not the case and this app is here to prove that you can still eat good sized meals with zero guilt or regret!

## Design

I did the design for this website using Balsamiq to create the wireframes. I have created wireframes for all pages on desktop, tablet and mobile.

### Fonts

For typograph I have used Pacifico for the main app title and also some page headings. I then used Roboto for main text sections some
the main text bodies are clear for the user to read.

### Colour Scheme

I wanted to keep the colour scheme soft so used a mixture of soft greens and off whites.
I have created a palette using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and it is displayed below.
